Things to do Today

Time complexity 

1) Best case 
various cases in best case

2) average case 
various cases in average case

3) worst case 

various cases such as

O(1)        = simple                  = this is completed 
O(n)        = (Nested loops) 1 loop   = done
O(log n)    =                         = has to be completed
O(n^2)      = (Nested loops) 2 loops  = this has been done and an example of this could be taking input for matrix or printing the matrix
O(n^3)      = (Nested loops) 3 loops  = this too has to be done but an example of this would be matrix multiplication
O(n log n)  =                         = this has to be done
O(2^x)      =                         = ye similar to n! hai lekin karlo example
O(n!)       =                         = Adnan bhai ka program tha kardiye done
